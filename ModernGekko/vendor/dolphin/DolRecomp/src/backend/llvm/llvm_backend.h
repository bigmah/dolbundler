// these objects the same way, because this backend emits IR and codegens it
// in-process -- clang never sees a translation unit. Sample/AutoFDO is
// genuinely unavailable (the emitter attaches no DILocation, so a sample
// profile has nothing to bind to), but IR-level *instrumentation* PGO needs no
// debug info: it is two LLVM passes run over the module the backend builds.

// Both are placed at the very front of the pipeline, on the raw emitter output,
// so the CFG hashes PGOInstrumentationUse matches against are computed on
// exactly the IR PGOInstrumentationGen saw. The lowering pass runs last, as
// clang does it, so the counter intrinsics stay opaque to the optimizer and
// cannot be sunk, merged or eliminated into wrong counts.
//
// -fprofile-generate must still reach the module link line, which is where the

// clang through CFLAGS writes IR-level counters into the same profile, so the

// A profile that no longer describes the emitted CFG does not fail. It

// at a time and leaves those functions unprofiled, so the build succeeds, the
// module looks trained, and the measurement is quietly against something
// between a profiled and an unprofiled arm. Clang's own warning for the C half
// (-Wprofile-instr-out-of-date) was suppressed on this project, and the LLVM
// half never had one at all.
//
// The gate is a POSITIVE check rather than a warning scrape: after
// PGOInstrumentationUse and the normal optimizer have run, every final defined
// function that matched its profile record carries entry-count metadata, and
// every function that did not carries none. On a profile collected from this
// same module that second set is empty, because IR instrumentation records
// EVERY function at gen time, whether or not the scene ever executed it. So a
// non-zero count means the profile and the DOL have diverged, not that the scene
// was narrow.
